<h1>AUTOMATIC1111's WebGUI</h1>
<h2>Custom Scripts & Extensions</h2>
<hr>
<article>
	<a href="index.html">Back to the main page</a>
	<p>This page covers extensions and custom scripts that enhance or add features to the AUTOMATIC1111 WebGUI. Custom scripts are easy to install by simply downloading and adding them to the scripts folder. Extensions on the other hand will usually need to be downloaded to the extensions folder via Git Bash or similar. It does work quite differently to prompt editing as firstly it is used in the img2img section and secondly, it uses loopback to iterate on the transition between prompts.</p>

    <h3>Custom Scripts</h3>
    <h4>Prompt Interpolate</h4>
    <p>This script by DiceOwl on Github allows you to take 2 seperate prompt strings and granually mix those two prompt strings together. It is an extension that seems to combine prompt editing with the AND operator to create a different mix between the two prompts.</p>
    <p>For more information visit the <a href="https://github.com/DiceOwl/StableDiffusionStuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DiceOwl Github page</a>.</p>
    
	<h4>Img2Tiles</h4>
    <p>Img2Tiles is a great extension made by Acanite24 on Github that lets you create a large image out of smaller images like a mosaic. Results can vary a lot but in general it's a very cool effect.</p>
    <p>For more information visit the <a href="https://github.com/arcanite24/img2tiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Acanite24 Github page</a>.</p>

	<h4>Alpha Canvas</h4>
	<p>Alpha Cancas is a better (although a bit cumbersome) way to use inpainting and outpainting using a similar UI seen in other Stable Diffusion websites/ programs. You can infinitly expand the canvas in blocks of 512x512 squares and place your expansion anyway on the image so you're not limited to a simple left, right, up, down direction.</p>
	<p>The current UI is very rough and I personally haven't been able to get the outpainting to work that well, but it's a good start for an improved outpainting system for the WebGUI.</p>

    <h3>Extensions</h3>
    <h4>Aesthetic Gradients</h4>
	<p>Aesthetic gradients are a way to influence the style of an image in a much more direct way without the need of training the model directly. In the webGUI, you must install it as an extension to be able to use them. For more information visit the <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-aesthetic-gradients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Aesthetic Gradient extension page</a>.</p>
	<p>If you've installed the extension correctly, you'll see a new section for aesthetic embeddings on the txt2img tab.</p>

	<h4>Deforum - Stable Diffusion experimental animation</h4>
	<p>Deforum is a way to create animated content within Stable Diffusion. However, in its current state it is very rough and there is no consistency in what it generates, it can only generate vaguly joint images. It's still a very interesting extension and could easily improve in the future to stay consistent between frames.</p>
